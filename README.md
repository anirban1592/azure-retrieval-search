This repository demonstrates different approaches to implement Azure AI Search, covering the complete pipeline from data extraction to indexing and search functionality. 

## Project Overview 🎯

Explore two distinct data chunking strategies for optimal search results:

### Master Branch 📚
- Implements data chunking using Langchain splitters
- Standard text segmentation approach
- May not always preserve semantic coherence

### Feature/llm_chunk Branch 🧠
- Utilizes LLM-based chunking strategy
- Enhanced semantic relationship preservation
- More context-aware text segmentation
